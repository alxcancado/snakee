Snakee
=================
Unity3D + C# + Classic Snake Game + 2D + Game
-----------------
This is the classical Snake game.

Snake game got extremely popular when after appearing in Nokia's 6110 phones (1997) but it's game concept comes from an older game from Gremlin, Blockade (1976).

What I more Enjoyed

. Create a simple Main Screen

. The new UI for Scoring, game "Walls". Fit in All resolutions!

. iOS gestures, Swipe as controls.

. Sound can keep playing after load a new Scene.

. Score: Last and Best

. Increase Snake speed after eat food. VVvuuussshhh!!!

. Still addictive! ... I got score 31 ;)

There are a lot to do yet but here is the basics.
Ideas can flow crazy :)
